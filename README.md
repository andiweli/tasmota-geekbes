# GEEKBES SP1 Tasmota Template

Update 13.02.2022 - correct LED lightning: red = off, blue = on

* Smart Plug Model SP1
* Wireless type Wi-Fi 2.4GHz
* Input AC 100-240V
* Max load 2200W 10A

The official template datebase over at https://templates.blakadder.com/ doesn't include a template for the rare "Geekbes SP1" single outlet.

It seems the device has been discontinued a few years ago. Even Amazon - where I bought mine in May 2018 - has deleted the product and now offers the 4-outlet "Geekbes 4AC+4USB Power Strip" instead of the product I bought. The single outlet can't be found anymore.

It offers nearly the same functions (including power monitoring) as the "Gosund SP1".
The SP1 from Geekbes won't work with the template of the Gosund outlet.
