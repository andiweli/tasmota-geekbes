Template for Geekbes SP1 single outlet

The official template datebase over at https://templates.blakadder.com/ doesn't include a template for the rare "Geekbes SP1" single outlet.

It seems the device has been discontinued a few years ago. Even Amazon - where I bought mine - has deleted the product and offers now the 4-outlet "Geekbes 4AC+4USB Power Strip". The single outlet can't be bought anymore.
It offers nearly the same functions (including power monitoring) as the "Gosund SP1" but has other parameters to work.

The SP1 from Geekbes won't work with the template of the Gosund outlet.
